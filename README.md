A **community controlled** repository of [relay](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain) and [parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#parachain-and-parathread-slots) information in the [Polkadot ecosystem](https://polkadot.network/).

The goals of this repo are:

1. Provide a community-managed index of Polkadot parachains and their connection information (rpcs, chainspecs)
1. Provide a source of chain and token assets across the ecosystem
1. Enable developers to retrieve this information via an API suitable to their project (json/rest, npm [**soonâ„¢**](https://github.com/TalismanSociety/chaindata/issues/35))
1. Move towards a decentralised model

## Usage

The files in this repo, `data/chaindata.json`, `data/testnets-chaindata.json` and `data/evm-networks.json` are used to configure a GitHub workflow which scrapes information from each chain and publishes it as a collection of JSON files in the `pub` directory of this repo.

The published files can be downloaded at these URLs:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TalismanSociety/chaindata/main/pub/v4/chaindata.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TalismanSociety/chaindata/main/pub/v4/chaindata.min.json

They are used by Talisman products via the `@talismn/chaindata-provider` library, which provides a `ChaindataProvider` that automatically synchronizes with these files to expose chains and tokens, alongside with typings and utilities.

For an example of a more advanced use-case, you can check out the source code for [Talisman Wallet](https://github.com/TalismanSociety/talisman).  
The wallet uses our `ChaindataProvider` for features like account balance subscriptions and sending funds.

## Chaindata `pub` versions

When breaking changes are made to the format of the built chaindata files, we increment the `pub` directory version.

Old directories are generally not kept up-to-date, but they are also not deleted.

The effect of this is that newer `@talismn/balances` releases will target the newer `pub` version, while older releases will continue to operate with the most up-to-date chaindata before the breaking change occurred.

A brief rundown of the changes introduced by each `pub` version:

- **`dist` -> `pub/v1`**  
  The miniMetadatas for the `substrate-native` balance module now include types for `Balances::Holds` and `Balances::Locks`.  
  Without upgrading `@talismn/balances`, these new types cause `PortableRegistry` to throw on construction of a `new Metadata(miniMetadata)`.

- **`pub/v1` -> `pub/v2`**  
  All miniMetadatas have been upgraded from metadata format v14 to v15.  
  Without upgrading `@talismn/balances`, the new format causes the library to throw.

- **`pub/v2` -> `pub/v3`**  
  Changed how some token ids are generated.

- **`pub/v4` -> `pub/v4`**  
  Refactored network and token objects.

## Contributing

To make a contribution, please fork this repo and make your changes in your fork, then open a PR to merge your changes back into this repo.

### To add chain or token logos:

#### Substrate chain logos

1. Identify the chain `id` from `networks-polkadot.yaml`
1. Add your logo (in `svg` format) to `assets/chains/${id}.svg`

#### EVM chain logos

1. Identify the chain `id` from https://chainlist.org  
   **Use the base-10 id** (e.g. `1`, or `137`), **not** the base-16 id (e.g. `0x1`, or `0x89`)
1. Add your logo (in `svg` format) to `assets/chains/${id}.svg`

#### Token logos

1. Add your logo (in `svg` format) to `assets/tokens/${symbol}.svg`
1. In `networks-polkadot.yaml` find the logo entry and set the `logo` property with the relative path of the token.

### To build the pub directory locally:

1. Install `pnpm` via [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) by running `corepack enable` on the command line
1. Clone the repo with  
   `git clone git@github.com:TalismanSociety/chaindata.git`
1. Install the dependencies with  
   `pnpm install`
1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the variables
1. Run the build with  
   `pnpm build`

### File structure

Only YAML files may be edited manually, JSON files are generated automatically as part of the CI.

The table below describes the purpose of each editable file.

| File name                                    | Purpose                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `data/networks-ethereum.json`                | List of Ethereum networks that are marked `isDefault: true` in Talisman         |
| `data/ethereum-known-networks-overrides.yaml | Overrides to [ethereum-lists](https://github.com/ethereum-lists), matched by id |
| `data/coingecko-overrides.yaml`              | Overrides logos of some coingecko tokens                                        |

## Dev Resources

#### Sections needing improvement

There are a few sections in this repo which could do with a tidy up.  
Here is a list of some of them, feel free to add more!

- The code for merging `known-evm-networks.json` with `data/networks-ethereum.json` is complex, stateful, full of side-effects and therefore difficult to re-use between the build stage and the fetch-external stage.  
  It is currently co-located inside of `scripts/build/steps/addEvmNetworks.ts`.  
  We should decide on a simpler mechanism for merging these two files, and extract the implementation of that into a util file.  
  An example of where this currently fails is in `scripts/fetch-external/steps/fetchErc20TokenSymbols.ts`.  
  In here we append the two files like so `const allNetworks = knownEvmNetworks.concat(evmNetworks)`, which results in duplicate networks in the `allNetworks` list.  
  This makes it difficult to e.g. extract a coingeckoId for a given erc20 contract address on a given network, since the code using `allNetworks` needs to account for duplicate networks with potentially conflicting information.

- Currently all of the EVM tokens are hydrated from known-tokens, while all substrate tokens are hydrated from tokens.json.  
  This is counter-intuitive, and so it leads to questions like "Why can I only see substrate tokens on chaindata? Are the EVM tokens missing / broken?"  
  We should either consolidate the two lists of tokens in one place, or change the naming used to clarify that not _all_ tokens can be found in one place.

#### Query the top 100 (by TVL) Uniswap V2 pool addresses

```shell
curl 'https://interface.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/graphql' \
-X 'POST' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Origin: https://app.uniswap.org' \
--data-binary '{"operationName":"TopV2Pairs","variables":{"first":100,"chain":"ETHEREUM"},"query":"query TopV2Pairs($chain: Chain!, $first: Int!, $cursor: Float, $tokenAddress: String) {\n  topV2Pairs(\n    first: $first\n    chain: $chain\n    tokenFilter: $tokenAddress\n    tvlCursor: $cursor\n  ) {\n    protocolVersion\n    address\n  }\n}"}'
```

Possible values for `chain` when this was written:

```
ARBITRUM, AVALANCHE, ETHEREUM, ETHEREUM_GOERLI, ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA, OPTIMISM, POLYGON, CELO, BNB, BASE, BLAST
```
